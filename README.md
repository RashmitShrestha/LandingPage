# LandingPage
This repo will host the landing page project from Udacity. 

# Description
Using some resources from Udacity, Stack Overflow, and W3Schools, I created a 
dynamically created, and interactive navbar. When you click on a button, it will
preform a smooth scrolling animation to the corresponding section. In addition, the
current section will be highlighted on the navbar which is fixed to the top of the screen.
